                    <p class="fspx-12 m-0 p-0">The climate is dry and warm in the summers and cold in the winter. It is reachable from Kaghan valley as well. Chilas is an hour away from Babusar Pass, which is hotter than Naran. Things that are important is to drink enough water to prevent sickness, and dress coolly! Tourism is on its peak in winters as they usually visit in winter vacations due to hot weather in summers.</p>
